## 1. What is RAG?

RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It’s a method that combines retrieval-based systems (which fetch relevant documents or knowledge) with generative models (like GPT) to produce accurate and contextually informed responses.

Instead of relying solely on the language model’s internal knowledge (which is fixed at training), RAG pulls in external knowledge at inference time, making answers up-to-date and factually grounded.

## 2. Core Idea

You have a query (question or prompt).

A retriever finds relevant documents from a knowledge base.

A generator uses both the query and retrieved documents to generate a response.

3. Components of a RAG Pipeline
A. Knowledge Base

A collection of documents or data.

Examples: PDFs, Wikipedia, internal company docs.

Often stored in vector databases (like Pinecone, Milvus, FAISS) for fast similarity search.

B. Document Embeddings

Convert documents into vectors using embeddings models (e.g., OpenAI embeddings, Sentence-BERT).

Each document chunk gets a vector that captures semantic meaning.

C. Retriever

Given a query, it converts the query into a vector.

Searches the knowledge base for similar vectors using cosine similarity or other metrics.

Returns top-k relevant documents.

D. Generator

Usually a large language model (LLM).

Input: query + retrieved documents.

Output: contextualized answer combining model knowledge + retrieved knowledge.
